## 🌍 Inspiration

Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and reducing carbon emissions is crucial to mitigating its impact. Shipping is a significant source of carbon emissions, and we wanted to create a tool that helps users calculate their carbon footprint during shipping and take action to reduce it.

## 🚛 What it does

Carbon Clean is a web app that allows users to calculate the carbon footprint created during shipping (air, road, and sea). It shows the impact of shipping in terms of kgs of CO2 produced and offers educational tips on how to reduce this footprint by incorporating a number of green and clean practices. Each tip is accompanied by study material and videos related to it. Users can even offset their carbon footprint by making donations to various organizations.

## 💻 How we built it

We built Carbon Clean using NextJS and Daisy UI. We used APIs to fetch the carbon footprint data and integrated it with the web app. The educational tips, study material, and videos were curated from various sources, and we used a CMS to manage them efficiently.

## 🤯 Challenges we ran into

One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating the APIs to fetch the carbon footprint data. We had to ensure that the data was accurate and up-to-date to provide users with the most reliable information. Additionally, curating the educational material and videos took time, and we had to ensure that we provided high-quality resources.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud of creating a web app that empowers users to take action to reduce their carbon footprint during shipping. We're also proud of the educational resources we've curated, which we hope will inspire users to adopt green and clean practices.

## 📚 What we learned

We learned a lot about the impact of shipping on the environment and the various ways in which we can reduce this impact. We also learned how to integrate APIs, curate educational resources, and manage a CMS effectively.

## 🔜 What's next for Carbon Clean

In the future, we plan to expand the educational resources available on Carbon Clean and offer more ways for users to offset their carbon footprint during shipping. We also plan to integrate additional features that will make it even easier for users to take action to reduce their carbon footprint.
